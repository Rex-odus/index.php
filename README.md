# index.php
Repository for hosting an HTML index page with PHP script to display files and their sizes in the current directory. Allows for easy navigation and downloading of files.

Directory Index Page

This repository contains an HTML index page with a PHP script that generates a directory listing. The script retrieves all files and subdirectories in the current directory, excluding the index.php file itself, and displays them in a sorted list.

Features:

    Displays files and subdirectories in the current directory
    Allows downloading files directly from the index page
    Sorts files alphabetically
    Shows file sizes in a human-readable format

Usage

Simply upload the index.php to your web server's directory, and the index page will automatically display the files and directories in that location.
